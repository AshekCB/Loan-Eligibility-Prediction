Project Title: Loan Eligibility Prediction using Logistic Regression
Overview: The Loan Eligibility Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is eligible for a loan based on various demographic and financial factors. The model utilizes logistic regression, a statistical technique for binary classification tasks, to estimate the probability of loan approval.
Features:
Gender: The gender of the loan applicant (e.g., Male, Female).
Marital Status: The marital status of the loan applicant (e.g., Married, Single, Divorced).
Dependents: The number of dependents the loan applicant has.
Education Status: The educational qualification of the loan applicant (e.g., Graduate, Not Graduate).
Self-Employment Status: Whether the loan applicant is self-employed or not.
Applicant Income: The income of the primary loan applicant.
Co-Applicant Income: The income of the co-applicant (if any).
Loan Amount: The amount of loan requested by the applicant.
Loan Amount Terms: The term (in months) for which the loan is requested.
Credit History: The credit history of the applicant (e.g., 1 for Good Credit History, 0 for Poor Credit History)
Property Area: The location of the property for which the loan is sought (e.g., Urban, Semi-Urban, Rural).
Target Variable: Loan Status: Whether the loan application was approved or not (Yes/No)

Methodology:
The project utilizes logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks, 
to build the predictive model. Logistic regression estimates the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.
User Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface developed using the Gredio library.
The interface allows users to input their demographic and financial information easily.
Upon submission, the model processes the data and provides a prediction on loan eligibility,
which is displayed to the user.Objective: The primary objective of the project is to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process, 
thereby improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
By accurately predicting loan eligibility, the model helps in making informed decisions, 
mitigating the risk of defaults, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Conclusion:
The Loan Eligibility Prediction project combines the power of machine learning with user-friendly interface design to streamline the loan approval process. 
By leveraging logistic regression and incorporating key demographic and financial features, the model provides accurate predictions,
contributing to more efficient and objective decision-making in the lending domain.
